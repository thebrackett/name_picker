# name picker
a set of simple name picking utilities for randomizing selection of words

## picker.py
Takes a list of names from a csv randomizes the order of the names and prints them to console. Handy for randomizing the order of a check-in meeting, etc.

##TODO
- Refactor picker.py to call functions, take params so script can also:
-   Picks one name at a time, types the name one letter at time, in a loop until no more names remain
-   Break team up into a specified number of sub-teams
